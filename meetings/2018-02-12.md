## Notes

Emailing Boaz

Tim work yesterday

* Domains updated with `dokku network:rebuildall`
* Forums instance not ready yet

Tesselcamp

* Setup a time during the week
* Should we send out open invitation for others to the meetup?

CodeTriage

* Open issues for open source projects, cleverly reduces the amount if a person isn't receptive
* You get on, on the waiting list, and we just got nominated!
* Open PR on this—should we accept it?
* @frijol spent her Sunday on triaging issues on the project repo and more
* t2-cli repo has a number of open crash reports (legit vs. user error)
* Crash reports could be good beginner issues
* Also #371

Sunday work session:

* @tcr Domains working again
* @frijol Cleanup of issues
* @hipsterbrown Worked on now.sh deployment for tessel.io with autodeployment with now.tessel.io

now.tessel.io
* CNAMEd to the appropriate domain
* @tcr: Will SSL continue to work?
* Just need team@tessel.io account
* Can use now desktop app or CLI or look at logs
* Do we want the blog separate from the website?

Static website
* On deck for @tcr and toward our April goal

Auto-compiler
* Francis is working on this: see #ops channel
* Paying $30 a month for our compiler process (Fargate requires a private subnet)
* Should run in the background making builds, but also we want an on-demand endpoint
* ECS t2-compiler task would take up more resources than we expected
* Use SAM should be more serverless
